Notes on skos:narrowMatch relationships - poolparty & Linked data API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
uploaded austConservation and bionetSchema, and linked the projects in PP.  Didn't link at concept level via the PP interface.
In austConservation, under Occurrence, I can see the number of NTs, but they don't display in the user interface.  Downloaded the schema
file and saw nothing much.  
Made narrow links via the UI & downloaded the file again. ==> in the XSL, changed narrower to narrowMatch (see downloaded
example below)
Deleted the concept scheme & re-uploaded.  Can see the narrowMatch terms but they show 'unknown source'

See related comment from Richard here - https://jira.ands.org.au/browse/SD-7519?focusedCommentId=67760&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-67760
"open the linked project, and examine the "URI Generation" setting in the bottom right of the view. The concept's IRI must begin the same way as the 
URI pattern shown there."

Recreated the two projects, using the URI patterns above, and uploaded the vocab file.  
Linked the schema project to the vocab project prior to uploading the schema file.
Uploaded the schema file, navigated to austConservation (in the schema project), and could see correctly linked narrower matching concepts. 
i.e. I didn't have to manually make the links via the user interface.  I clicked on one of the narrow matching hyperlinks, but
access was denied.  I opened austConservation & checked that it is linked from that side.  Then I tried making both projects public.  They display ok
but can't get the concepts to display.

I creaated two new vocabs in the ANDS portal

The narrow matches appear in the linked data api, but don't resolve.
